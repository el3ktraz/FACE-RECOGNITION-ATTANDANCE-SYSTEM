THIS PROJECT IS CREATED USING PYTHON , AND A SIMPLE KNN ALGORITHM 
Requirements.txt is not created , fully working project , change vediocapture() value to 1-0 for default cam or external web cam 
after adding names take 100 images , or else dataset gets courrupted 
you can create an issue if you find any 

the documentation is not proper   you can make changes to it
